# TypeScript in 2 mins (ts-in-2mins).
How much can you learn in 2mins?.

This project helps me to learn or revise concepts of TypeScript. 

Try code samples on JavaScript / TypeScript.

TypeScript project setup was done using this [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project).

## Scripts
* `$npm run compile`, compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.
* `$npm run execute`, executes the TypeScript code. You can see the console outputs on the terminal itself.
